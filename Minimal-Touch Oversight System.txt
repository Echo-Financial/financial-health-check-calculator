# Minimal-Touch Oversight System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Minimal-Touch Oversight System provides a balanced approach to compliance, allowing automated financial advice while maintaining professional oversight through a risk-based review approach.

## How It Works

1. **All Advice is Logged**: Every piece of advice generated by the system is automatically logged in a compliance record.

2. **Risk-Based Flagging**: Certain advice is automatically flagged for human review based on predefined thresholds:

   - **High Value Recommendations**: Monthly contributions >$1,000, investments >$1,500
   - **Client Risk Factors**: Low scores in critical areas, high income, near retirement
   - **Unusual Targets**: Very high retirement targets, high debt levels
   - **Priority Clients**: Specific clients who always require review

3. **Streamlined Review Process**: A simple dashboard allows quick review of flagged advice.

4. **Documentation Trail**: All reviews are documented, providing evidence of appropriate oversight.

## Threshold Configuration

The default thresholds can be adjusted in the `complianceUtils.js` file. Current thresholds include:

- Monthly retirement contribution: >$1,000
- Monthly investment: >$1,500
- Emergency fund + retirement scores: both <20
- Annual income: >$200,000
- Near retirement with low score: age >60 and retirement score <50
- Retirement target: >$2,000,000
- Total debt: >$500,000

## Compliance Dashboard Usage

1. Access the dashboard at `/compliance-dashboard`
2. Review flagged records
3. Add review notes
4. Mark records as reviewed

## Regular Audits

In addition to the threshold-based reviews, implement a process for periodic random reviews (5-10% of all advice) to ensure quality control.

## Technical Implementation

The system uses MongoDB to store compliance records and a simple Express API to manage the review process. The frontend dashboard is built with React and Bootstrap.
